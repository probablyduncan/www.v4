			<p>hen I made my first abstracts of Lake Michigan—see those <a href="blue.html">here</a>—it felt as though I had entered a whole new world. No longer did I pass off that pastel expanse as un-photographable; I had found a way which did that vastness justice. </p>
			<p>And so, when 2019's first blizzard let up and the clouds left the sky, I headed down to the lake with optimism, purpose, and a camera.</p>
			<p>When I finally made it down to the lake, the beach was covered in ice. As I walked out past the normal shoreline, past submerged and frozen anchors of summer swim-buoys, I thought about how unfortunate it would be if my feet found a weak spot in the snow.</p>
			<p>I reached the end of the solid ice and stopped. Up to this point, the thick ice, thicker than I am tall, was covered in a substantial layer of dense, frozen snow. However, past this point, the ice floated free. Chunks of ice about the size of a snow-angel undulated slowly on the dark, icy water. The western sky to my right was fiery, and it refleced on exposed patches of water and on the slick, white ice.</p>
			<p>I stayed upon the ice for roughly 20 minutes, at which point my wind-bitten fingers no longer responded to my brain's plea to click the camera's shutter. In that time, I witnessed a wide spectrum of colors and a heard a symphony of silence. Here are some of the photos from that frigid evening which warmed my soul.</p>
