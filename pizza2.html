			<p>izza has long been a staple of the modern western diet, adorning the tables of birthday parties, school dances, and office socials. It even defines its own gathering: the pizza party. It is convenient, unifying, and versatile, with cauliflower crusts for the gluten free, cheeseless cheese for the lactose intolerant, and pineapple on top for the criminally insane.</p>
            
            <p>However, in today’s hyper-health-conscious world, pizza reigns as an epitome of poor nutrition. High in saturated fats, sodium, and refined carbohydrates, modern pizza has the power to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1172/JCI89444" target="_blank">damage</a> metabolism and insulin resistance, leading to diabetes, liver disease, and other complications. Worse yet, modern, processed pizza is addictive; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0117959" target="_blank">one study</a> used survey data to rank pizza as the fourth most addictive food, behind chocolate, ice cream, and french fries.</p>
            
            <p>Despite pizza’s evident drawbacks, a possibility remains to harness pizza’s place in the zeitgeist in order to benefit public health. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1017/S1368980013002814" target="_blank">Researchers</a> found success with a “health-by-stealth” approach, which aims to improve rather than replace common junk food. Unprocessed, traditional pizza is relatively healthy, with whole-wheat flour, fresh tomatoes and cheese, and vegetable toppings. Thus, creating a nutritionally balanced pizza is relatively simple. By adjusting ingredients in the dough, sauce, and cheese and adding toppings to supplement nutrition, researchers created a pizza which, while remaining delicious, includes the recommended calories for a single meal, as well as reasonable levels of sodium, fat, and fibre. This traditional, health-conscious pizza has been linked to lower risk of <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601997" target="_blank">heart attacks</a> and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/ijc.11382" target="_blank">several cancers</a>. Additionally, olive oil and vegetables, both common on pizza, are <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.bjc.6690400" target="_blank">inversely related</a> to risk of throat cancers. At its essence, pizza is a force for good. While its modern form is extremely detrimental to human health, pizza’s future is as bright as its storied past.</p>
